After taking a 13 year hiatus from KDE development, [Harald Sitter's talk on KDE Linux](https://tube.kockatoo.org/w/exAQYJWrXoQSU1EDXidjr3) at Akademy 2024 was the perfect storm of nostalgia and inspiration to suck me back in. I've been contributing on and off since then.

This blog post outlines some gaping holes I see in its extensibility model, and how I plan to address them (assuming no objections from other developers).

## The Problem

- immutable OS 
- ships with a set of developer tools we decide
- if you want anything else, here's a wiki page containing some suggestions that we don't officialy support (and mostly don't use ourselves)
- tl;dr: like how KDE Neon got a reputation as "for testing KDE software", it will get a reputation as "for developing KDE software only"
